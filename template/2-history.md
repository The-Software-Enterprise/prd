# History

During the semester, we created a proof-of-concept (POC) with only fundamental features like News, Event Applications, and Tickets. This version included a combination of authenticated and unauthenticated functionalities to demonstrate the app's potential value. However, the POC was entirely hardcoded, with each feature being a distinct module within the Android app. To ensure the success of Student Sphere, we need to reimagine the product with a focus on scalability. Therefore, the MVP will necessitate a complete architectural redesign.
