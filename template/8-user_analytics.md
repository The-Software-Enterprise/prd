# User Analytics and Acceptance

During the life of the application, we must collect different data about user behaviors to be able to adapt to the market. To achieve this, we need to define metrics to collect, determine when these metrics indicate success, and analyze them.

## Key Metrics
- **User Engagement**: As it's not a daily used app, we should analyze user engagement on a weekly or monthly active user basis.
- **Sign Up Rate**: The number of users signing up for the app.
- **Number of News/Events Published**: This represents whether the associations are active on the app.
- **Number of Event/Association Staffing**: This indicates whether users are engaging with the app to participate in association activities.

## Success Criteria
- **High User Sign Up**: Approaching the total number of students at the university.
- **Event Addition**: All events added to the platform.
- **Staffing Activity**: Active participation and staffing via the platform during the period.

## Analysis
- Use **Google Analytics** to collect user interactions.
- Gather and compute the mean engagement of associations and events.
- User information should be anonymized as it is not needed.

## A/B Testing
- **Notifications**: Try different notifications for events, following associations, and suggestions.
- **UI Variations**: Test different UI designs for news and events, and the button to join.
