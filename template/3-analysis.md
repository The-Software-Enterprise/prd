# Analysis of the Situation

At present, each EPFL association's communication platform is accessed individually. As an EPFL student, I must visit Instagram for photos and videos, the association's website to apply, and fill out a Google form to volunteer at events. Additionally, I can't view activities from associations I'm not connected to. This fragmentation leads to many students being unaware of the numerous associations on campus and their activities, and often, they don't even know these associations exist.
