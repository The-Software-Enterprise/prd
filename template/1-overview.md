# Overvie# Overview

StudentSphere is an app designed to improve, fluidify, and most importantly, centralize communication between university campus associations and students. It allows associations to keep the rest of the university updated with their most recent news, events, and various activities. Through this app, event tickets, staffing, postulating to events, and joining committees are all centralized.

The app is designed to be extendable, allowing for the seamless integration of additional services over time to support an all-in-one model. The services available fall into two main categories: those that offer direct access to the associations' information on the phone without requiring any authentication, and those that necessitate authentication. For the latter, StudentSphere serves as a platform, enabling users to connect with their preferred associations, manage event tickets, and handle postulations. All authenticated services are facilitated through Firebase.

The app is available at no cost to all university collaborators, who represent the main target audience for this application.

Our plan is to develop this app independently, minimizing reliance on EPFL's IT infrastructure.

The objective of the MVP is to develop a basic yet functional app that gains substantial traction within the EPFL student community. Success will be measured by the total number of downloads, the count of monthly active users, and the number of students who have securely linked their EPFL SSO credentials to the app.

Our goal is for StudentSphere to be cross-platform.
