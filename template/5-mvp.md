# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

The Student Sphere MVP aims to bring all student associations' most used resources under one roof to meet the value proposition identified above. High user retention will serve as a key metric for EPFL to ensure the success and sustainability of this service for its students. We identify ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) below and list the set of features that we think are used enough to generate repeat traffic.

Concretely, we aim to integrate the following services into Student Sphere:

1.	**News feed:** Keeps students informed about the latest happenings within the associations.
2.	**Event feed:** Provides information about upcoming events, making it easy for students to stay engaged with association activities.
3.	**Association details page:** Offers comprehensive information about each association.
4.	**Application for staffing at events:** Simplifies the process of applying to staff at events, making it easier for students to get involved.
5.	**Application for joining an association:** Streamlines the membership application process, encouraging more students to join associations.
6.	**Ticket system:** An integrated system for ticket attribution, ensuring seamless allocation and management of tickets for event attendees.
7.	**NFC ticket scanning system:** Provides a convenient method for checking tickets at events, enhancing the overall event management experience.
8.	**Association management:** Allows members of an association to manage their association's page, events, news, applications, and tickets.

## Success Criteria

User adoption and engagement 

- Target to onboard at least 10% of the campus population within the first month of launch.
- Achieve a DAU of 10% and MAU of 70% in the same month.
- Achieve a retention rate of at least 60% in the following month. 

Feedback and satisfaction

- Achieve a minimum average rating of 4 out of 5 stars on app stores within the first two months of launch.
- Conduct monthly surveys to gather user feedback, aiming for at least 80% positive feedback regarding app usefulness and user experience. 
- Implement at least half of the user-requested features or improvements within two weeks following each feedback survey. Promptly responding to user requests not only demonstrates our commitment to continuously enhancing the user experience but also significantly contributes to building and maintaining user trust in our platform. 

Commitment from EPFL IT

- Engage with EPFL IT at the executive level without delay
- Discuss terms for first contact before the user adoption criteria are met, conditional on their achievement. 

## Features Outside the Scope

- **Chat Feature:** Although a chat feature could significantly enhance user engagement, particularly in staffing and committee application processes, it is not essential for the MVP.
- **Co-Joined Events:** The ability to co-join events would undoubtedly enrich the user experience. However, it is not a fundamental requirement for the MVP.
- **Association Planning Management:** Having a feature to manage association planning could immensely benefit association members and staff. Nevertheless, it's not a critical feature for the MVP.
- **Payment System:** Integrating a payment system could improve the ticketing experience for users, but it is not a necessary component of the MVP.
